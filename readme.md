# Day 001 

## Victory Module, and example

This little piece of work is intended be called at the end of a program you've had a lot of difficulty with. More specifically for when you 
feel petty and its late and you're irritated and you've been working on it and you just cant seem to get it right. 

When you finally show that code who's boss, your boy Cal will tell it whats what. or if you'd rather have something a lot classier 
or more SFW, you can turn on ther Family friendly flag and a much more generic but satisfying sound of success will play.
